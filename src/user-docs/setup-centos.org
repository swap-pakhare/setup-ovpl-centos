* Objective

The objective of these instructions is to set up the =Centos= on your
machine as a virtual lab deployment platform.

* Prerequisites

** Your machine has CentOS version =6.5= or greater running on it. 

You can know that by typing
#+BEGIN_example
cat /etc/issue
#+END_example

The output should be 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
CentOS release 6.5 (Final)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Your machine has a 64 bit architecture

To find out, type
#+BEGIN_example
grep flags /proc/cpuinfo
#+END_example


The output should include the word "lm" (for long mode, indicating 64
bit) as one of the flags.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
flags : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov
pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe nx rdtscp *lm*
constant_tsc arch_perfmon pebs bts xtopology nonstop_tsc aperfmperf
pni dtes64 monitor ds_cpl vmx est tm2 ssse3 cx16 xtpr pdcm pcid sse4_1
sse4_2 popcnt lahf_lm arat dtherm tpr_shadow vnmi flexpriority ept
vpid
#+END_EXAMPLE

** You are on the Internet

The installation pulls packages from open repositories and you will need
an Internet connection to run the scripts successfully. 

** You have sudo permissions as root
The scripts install software using yum - a package management
utility - which can run only in sudo root mode.  Therefore, invoke the
script with a =sudo= command.  Be careful!  Reckless execution of
commands with root permission could make your machine inoperable!

* Instructions for installation
** Changing to the right directory

Please use the structure of the LIK, and change directory to =lik-release-0.5.0/ovpl-kit/scripts= 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd lik-release-0.5.0/ovpl-kit/scripts
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Edit the configurations to set proxy
   Edit =config.sh= to set up proxies
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
vim config.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

Edit the config file to set the =http_proxy= and =https_proxy= fields.
If there are no proxies to be set, leave the fields unchanged.
The snippet below shows how to set proxies.

   + To set the proxies.
#+begin_src example
    "ENVIRONMENT": {
        "HTTP_PROXY":"http://proxy. vlabs.ac.in:8080",
        "HTTPS_PROXY":"http://proxy.vlabs.ac.in:8080"
    },
#+end_src

   + if no proxies are used, 
#+begin_src example
    "ENVIRONMENT": {
        "HTTP_PROXY":"",
        "HTTPS_PROXY":""
    },
#+end_src

** Get the =openVZ= template

=cd= to the =meta= directory.  Download the  openVZ template OS:
#+begin_example
cd ../meta  
wget community.virtual-labs.ac.in/downloads/ubuntu-12.04-custom-x86_64.tar.gz
#+end_example

** Run the script to prepare centos
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd ../scripts
sudo ./centos_prepare_ovpl.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Your machine is now ready with prerequisites of ADS. Follow these
   [[https://github.com/vlead/setup-ovpl-centos/blob/master/user-docs/how-to-deploy-a-lab.org][instructions]] to deploy a lab.
