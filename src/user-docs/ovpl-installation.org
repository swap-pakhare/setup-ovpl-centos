* Objective 
This presentation guides through the process of OVPL Installation process.

Pre-requisites:
- System with CentOS 6.5 successfully installed
(It is assumed that CentOS is installed on a separate partition of your disk)


* Setting Up OVPL for CentOS
In the scripts directory, "centos_prepare_ovpl.sh" will set up the OVPL on Your CentOS.

To run:
#+begin_src shell
 sh centos_prepare_ovpl.sh
#+end_src 
The steps next explain what happens when the script runs.


* Ready to start
The script initially checks if you are in super user mode, if you have all the necessary files to run the scripts and proxies are set if required. If any fails prompts the user and script has to be run again after the necessary action. 


* Installing OVPL Dependencies
The script
#+begin_src shell
install_dependencies.sh
#+end_src
is called to install the necessary dependencies to run the OVPL. The dependencies description can be found under "FAQ" and "understanding-scripts" documents.

The process terminates in case of any failure. User needs to trouble shoot and re-run the script.


* Installing openVZ
Next step is to install openVZ. script
#+begin_src shell
 install_openvz.sh
#+end_src 
is called for the installation.
