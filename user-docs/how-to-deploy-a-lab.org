* Settings for ADS 
  Check [[https://github.com/vlead/setup-ovpl-centos/blob/master/user-docs/setup-centos.org][prerequisites]] to run ADS (Auto Deployment Service) as a
  Service.  If these all prerequisites are already exists, please
  Continue with the following instructions to configure and then run
  ADS as a service:

** Main Settings
   Edit the file =ovpl/config/config.json= 
#+begin_src example
cd ../ovpl/config
vim config.json
#+end_src

  + To set the proxies.
#+begin_src example
    "ENVIRONMENT": {
        "HTTP_PROXY":"http://proxy. vlabs.ac.in:8080",
        "HTTPS_PROXY":"http://proxy.vlabs.ac.in:8080"
    },
#+end_src

  + if no proxies are used, 
#+begin_src example
    "ENVIRONMENT": {
        "HTTP_PROXY":"",
        "HTTPS_PROXY":""
    },
#+end_src
  
    + Set the COOKIE_SECRET value in CONTROLLER_CONFIG to some long
    randomly generated string.

#+begin_src example
"COOKIE_SECRET": "<generate a long random UUID>",
#+end_src

  + Leave the PERSONA_VERIFIER field as it is, if you are using the
    Mozilla's default Persona provider service.
  
  + Change APP_URL field and put the URL where the application is
    hosted.
#+begin_src example
     "APP_URL": "http://ads-server-public-ip:8080",
#+end_src

  + Choosing ADAPTER_NAME:In the ADAPTER section, change the
    ADAPTER_NAME to "CentOSVZAdapter".

#+begin_src example
"ADAPTER": {
        "ADAPTER_NAME" :"CentOSVZAdapter",
	}
#+end_src

  + Set the SERVER_IP in LOGSERVER_CONFIGURATION to the IP address of
    the machine on which the ADS services are running.
#+begin_src example
"LOGSERVER_CONFIGURATION": {
            "SERVER_IP": "ads-server-private-ip",
	    },
#+end_src


  + Copy =config/sample_authorized_users.py= to
    =config/authorized_users.py= to add email addresses.
#+begin_src example
cp sample_authorized_users.py authorized_users.py
#+end_src

  + Add actual email addresses of authorized users.

** Settings for CentOSVZAdapter
   
   Edit the file =ovpl/src/adapters/settings.py= to set the following:
#+begin_src example
cd ../src/adapters
vim settings.py
#+end_src
   1. If the services are running on the base machine, set
      ADS_ON_CONTAINER to False.

   2. If the services are running on a container, set ADS_ON_CONTAINER
      to True.

   3. Set BASE_IP_ADDRESS = "root@<IP>" where IP is the ip address of
      base machine on which containers are created.

   4. Set ADS_SERVER_VM_ID to CTID of container running ADS.
      ADS_SERVER_VM_ID = "<CTID>"

   5. SUBNET field to match with the subnet of your base machine If
      the ip address of your base machine is 10.2.58.XXX, SUBNET =
      ["10.2.58.12/28"]

** Commands to Manage the Service
+ As root, go into =src= directory and run make:
#+begin_src example
$ cd ../src
$ make
#+end_src

+ To stop the services, or restart
#+begin_src example
$ cd src
$ make stop-server
$ make restart-server
#+end_src

+ View the logs at /root/logs/ovpl.log by
#+begin_src example
tail -f /root/logs/ovpl.log
#+end_src


* Deploy a Lab

At this point, ADS is running and you are ready to deploy a lab.

- To deploy your lab ::
     - Open the browser.
     - Enter =localhost:8080= as the url.
     - The form requires you to fill =Lab ID=. You may assign any new
       alphanumeric name as a lab id.
     - Also, fill in the =Repo url= with the url of the lab sources on
       github repository.
     - Click =submit= to deploy your lab.
     - If the deployment is successful, an =IP address= will appear in
       the same browser window.
     - Enter the =IP address= in the address bar to view the newly
       deployed lab.
